	<h1>The Best Movies According to Dwi</h1>
	<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time</h2>
	<hr>
	<h3>Habibie Ainun</h3>
	<p>The best "Habibie & Ainun" film, deep love story, extraordinary acting. Ainun and Habibie's inspirational fighting spirit, moving and motivating works of art.</p>
	<h3>Imperfect</h3>
	<p>This film conveys a message about courage, self-confidence, and acceptance of individual uniqueness. This positive message inspires a broader view of beauty.</p>
	<h3>Dua Garis Biru</h3>
	<p>'Two Blue Lines' is the best because the social theme of teenage pregnancy has a strong impact. The courage to raise sensitive issues was appreciated as an inspirational work with a strong moral message.</p>
